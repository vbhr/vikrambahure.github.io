                                            In a traditional marriage market, a family’s preferences
                                            and beliefs over bride types play a significant role in
                                            matching. In this paper, we study how an exogenous
                                            increase in education, a preferred attribute for women
                                            in the marriage market, affects her age at marriage. The
                                            District Primary Education Program (DPEP) launched in
                                            1994, provides a regression discontinuity set-up to
                                            estimate the causal impact of education. We find that
                                            the program lead to an increase in women’s education by
                                            1.5 years. Next, we use the program as an instrument for
                                            the increase in education. In contrast to the
                                            literature, we find a decrease in the age at marriage by
                                            1.3 years due to increase in primary education. Using a
                                            simple transferable utility model, we provide a
                                            framework for a negative relationship between education
                                            and the age at marriage. As educated and young brides
                                            are more desirable in the marriage market, educated
                                            women are cleared from the marriage market before less
                                            educated women. Further, we find that an increase in
                                            education leads to a stable match. Finally, we check if
                                            the effect of education on age at marriage varies by the
                                            availability of outside option in the labor market. Our
                                            results indicate that educated women in high-wage
                                            districts on average marry later than the low-wage
                                            districts.

                                                Network Size and Temporary Migration
                                            </h5>
                                            <p>
                                                In this paper, I study the impact of network size on
                                                temporary migration. Network size reflects the
                                                extent of the informal risk-sharing options
                                                available to a rural household. Temporary migration
                                                is another form of self-insurance in the rural
                                                economy. I particularly focus on how the impact of
                                                network size varies depending on the endowment of
                                                the network, and show that the channel is via credit
                                                constraints for the low endowed network. I use the
                                                Indian Human Development Survey 2011-12 data to
                                                construct a measure of network size based on the
                                                caste of the households. To establish causality, I
                                                use historical caste-wise population shares from the
                                                1961 census as an instrument of network size and low
                                                permanent migration regions. I find that there is a
                                                decrease in temporary migration in highly-endowed
                                                upper caste networks and an increase in temporary
                                                migration for the low-endowed lower caste networks.
                                                Further, I investigate the economic mechanisms using
                                                exogenous variation in network income due to
                                                negative rainfall shock. I show that an increase in
                                                the network size reduces the credit constraints of
                                                the low-endowment lower caste households via the
                                                income of the network.

                                                Temporary migration is widespread in developing
                                                countries. There is evidence of potential gains from
                                                temporary migration, however, the household members
                                                left behind especially the women are vulnerable to
                                                idiosyncratic shocks. This paper measures the impact
                                                of reducing credit market imperfections at the place
                                                of origin by providing loans to female members of
                                                the migrant household. I use a unique dataset
                                                provided by Shram Sarathi, a credit organisation in
                                                Rajasthan, India. Using an instrumental variable
                                                approach this paper finds a positive impact of loans
                                                to female members of a migrant household on the
                                                household well being indicators such as consumption,
                                                livestock holding, asset holding, and savings. There
                                                exist heterogeneous effects depending on the
                                                household asset holding and migrant duration type.
                                                The positive impact of the loan is larger for the
                                                households with lower asset holding and long
                                                duration migrants.
