                                            We study the impact of an increase in women's education on their age at marriage. Exploiting 
                                            a regression discontinuity for a large-scale school construction program in India, we find 
                                            that the program increases women's education by 0.8-1.5 years, and decreases their age at 
                                            marriage by 0.44 years for a one-year increase in education. Next, we find that post-marriage, 
                                            educated women experience less domestic violence, better health care, lower fertility levels, 
                                            and a wealthy match in the marriage market. Using an ad-hoc matching framework, we show that 
                                            men's preference in the marriage market for young and educated brides leads to a fall in age 
                                            at marriage. Finally, we find a 25 percent increase in women's wages leads to a delay in age at 
                                            marriage by 0.1 years. This highlights the complementary role of education and labor market policies 
                                            to delay women's age at marriage.

                                            <p>
                                                In this paper, I study the impact of network size on
                                                temporary migration. Network size reflects the
                                                extent of the informal risk-sharing options
                                                available to a rural household. Temporary migration
                                                is another form of self-insurance in the rural
                                                economy. I particularly focus on how the impact of
                                                network size varies depending on the endowment of
                                                the network, and show that the channel is via credit
                                                constraints for the low endowed network. I use the
                                                Indian Human Development Survey 2011-12 data to
                                                construct a measure of network size based on the
                                                caste of the households. To establish causality, I
                                                use historical caste-wise population shares from the
                                                1961 census as an instrument of network size and low
                                                permanent migration regions. I find that there is a
                                                decrease in temporary migration in highly-endowed
                                                upper caste networks and an increase in temporary
                                                migration for the low-endowed lower caste networks.
                                                Further, I investigate the economic mechanisms using
                                                exogenous variation in network income due to
                                                negative rainfall shock. I show that an increase in
                                                the network size reduces the credit constraints of
                                                the low-endowment lower caste households via the
                                                income of the network.

                                                In this paper, I measure the impact of reducing credit market 
                                                imperfections at the place of origin by providing loans to female 
                                                members of the migrant household. I use a unique dataset provided 
                                                by Shram Sarathi, a credit organisation in Rajasthan, India. Using 
                                                past positive rainfall shock as an instrumental variable for gender of the applicant, 
                                                this paper finds a positive impact of loans to female members of migrant

                                                A significant proportion of members of legislative assemblies in India have pending 
                                                criminal cases against them. This study examines the first-order effect of electing 
                                                a criminally accused politician (CAP) on the law and order of the constituency. 
                                                Regression discontinuity estimates show that electing a CAP leads to a substantial 
                                                increase in crime against women, homicide, and riots and affray. Further evidence 
                                                shows that there is a fall in public trust in the police force and a significant increase 
                                                in the number of pending criminal cases in the court. Electing a CAP weakens the state capacity 
                                                through reporting and prosecution effect.
